# shopping-app-firebase
This small app is for purchasing Apple products. I wrote this app to practice using React.js and React-Link & Route & BrowserRouter. 

Live Website:  
2-min Video Demo:  

# Build with 
Frontend: React.js, React-Link & Route & BrowserRouter, uuidv4, Responsive Web Design. 

# App Features
Add to shopping cart:  

Go back a page without losing items in cart:   

uuid: each item was generated an unique ID:  

# Challenges
This is my first time using React-Router in React.js. Linking webpages while pass props and states was very confusing as I lost track where they pointed to. However, I believe this is the next phrase I need to be to be proficient at React.js.  

# Deployment
`npm start`.
